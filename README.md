# E-commerce Sales Analysis in R
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data using R to uncover actionable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and revenue patterns. Leveraging powerful libraries like dplyr and ggplot2, it explores key performance indicators through robust data manipulation and visualization to inform business strategy.

## Features

* **Sales Performance Analysis:**
    * Analyze total orders and revenue by day of the week.
    * Visualize weekly and monthly sales trends.
* **Customer Behavior Insights:**
    * Calculate and track the average order value over time.
    * Identify peak shopping hours by analyzing order distribution by time of day.
* **Data Visualization:**
    * Create insightful and visually appealing plots using `ggplot2`.
    * Use various chart types, including bar charts, line charts, and donut charts, to represent the data.

## Technologies Used

* **R:** The core programming language for the analysis.
* **R Libraries:**
    * `ggplot2`: For creating static and dynamic data visualizations.
    * `dplyr`: For data manipulation and transformation.
    * `tidyr`: For tidying and reshaping data.

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your system.
    * Install the necessary R packages by running the following command in your R console:
        ```R
        install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyr", "dplyr"))
        ```

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-sales-analysis.git](https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-sales-analysis.git)
    cd ecommerce-sales-analysis
    ```

3.  **Load the script:**
    * Open the R script (`analysis.R`) in RStudio.
    * Make sure the dataset (`Sales.csv`) is in the same directory as the script, or update the file path in the script.

4.  **Run the analysis:**
    * Execute the script in RStudio to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Dataset

This project uses the "E-commerce Sales Dataset," which should be downloaded and placed in the project directory. The dataset contains information about orders, including order dates, revenue, and other relevant details.

You can replace this with your own e-commerce dataset, but you may need to adjust the column names and data cleaning steps in the script accordingly.
